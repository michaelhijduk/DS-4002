It is that you are looking right at the brilliant light now. That the experience you are having that you call ordinary everyday consciousness -- pretending you're not 'it' -- that experience is exactly the same thing as 'it'. There's no difference at all. And when you find that out, you laugh yourself silly. That's the great discovery. In other words, when you really start to see things, and you go into the nature of what it is to see, what vision is, or what smell is, or what touch is, you realize that that vision is the brilliant light of the cosmos\n\nIf I would know you, would you know me?\nIf I would know you, would you know me?\nIf I would know you, would you know me?\nIf I would know you, would you know me?\n\nDon't go\nTell me that the lights won't change\nTell me that we'll stay the same\nWhere we go, where we\nWhere we go, where we go\nWhere we go, where we go\nWhere we go"
