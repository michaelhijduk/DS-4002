No"

that gave the track pain\nBought the chain that always give me back pain\nFuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane\nChi nigga, but these hoes love my accent\nChick came up to me and said,

world\nI'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls\nI'm not just another individual\nMy spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual\nBut I get my hymns from Him\nSo it's not me, it's He that's lyrical\nI'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument\nMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental\nThat's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into\nYeah, I need my loot by rent day\nBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte\nI'm trying to get us \"us free\" like Cinque\nI can't stop, that's why I'm hot\nDetermination, dedication, motivation\nI'm talking to you of my many inspirations\nWhen I say I can't let you or self down\nIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff\nAnd you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life\nIn my grip, I would never, ever let you down\nAnd when these words are found\nLet it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love\nThat's why my breath is felt by the deaf\nAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind\nI, too, dream in color and in rhyme\nSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house\n'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth\nA touch of God reigns out\nTake 'em to church\n\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I found, one thing I found\nOh, no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get down\n\nWho else you know been hot this long?\n(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)\nStarted from nothing but he got this strong\n(The Roc is in the building)\nBuilt the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you\nPedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Woo-hoo)\nLet you tell it, man, I'm falling\nWell, somebody must have caught him\n'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em\nNumber one albums, what I got? Like four of them\nMore of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way\nClear the way, I'm here to stay\nY'all can save the chitter chat, this and that\nDissin' Jay, dissin' Jay'll get you maced\nWhen I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious\nSix Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'\nYoung, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas\nThe way y'all all follow Jigga\nHov's a living legend and I'll tell you why\nEverybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive"

tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 [\nGunshots\n]\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it \nSection.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, bullshit\nAnd when I die...\n\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooh\n\n\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother\u2014nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we\u2014nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga\u2014bruh\u2014nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called \nThe Dynasty\n. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre \nChronic 2001\n at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on \nThe Dynasty\n album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, \nThe Streets is Watching\n, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, \nBlueprint\n, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-\nBlueprint\n beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?"

Nigga, I can name several\nSituations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'\nA baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?\nWhere was your antennas? Where was the influence you speak of?\nYou preached in front of one-hundred-thousand but never reached her\nI fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader\nI never liked you, forever despise you, I don't need you\nThe world don't need you, don't let them deceive you\nNumbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication\nThought money would change you, made you more complacent\nFuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it\n\nI swear, loving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\n\nLoving you, loving you, not loving you, 100 proof\nI can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me\nYes, I hate you, too\n\n\n(\nLoving you ain't really complicated\n) Housekeeping\nHousekeeping (\nWhat I got to do to get to you?\n), \u00a1abre la puerta!\n\u00a1Abre la puerta, tengo que limpiar el cuarto!

(\nLoving you ain't really complicated\n)\nWhat I got to do to get to you?\nTo you, and\u2014\n\nAnd you the reason why mom and them leavin'\nNo, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it\nI know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it\nYour trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it\nEveryone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out\nYou was deserted, where was your antennas again?\nWhere was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?\nYou ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend\nA friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother\nYou promised you'd watch him before they shot him\nWhere was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches\nYou FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven\nYou even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit\nGuess you thought he'd recover well\nThird surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real\nThen he died, God himself will say, \"You fuckin' failed,\" you ain't try\n\nI know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga\nI know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga\nI know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga\nY'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga\nAnd if this bottle could talk\nI cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault\nFaults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend\nBecause you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed\nI know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world about that shit you thinkin'\nAnd that time that\u2014 I'm 'bout to hurl\nI'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you\nYou just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof\nShould've killed yo' ass long time ago\nYou should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago\nAnd if these mirrors could talk, it'll say, \"You gotta go\"\nAnd if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness"

I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?\n\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'\nTo help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was, it was you\nDamn"

He got it like new powers\nWoke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours\nSheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club\nHad your fam saying, \"Please make me a dub\"\nWell, since you ask kindly\nWhere he been behind the mask, who can't find me?\nYou're blind, in the wine zone, leave your mind blown\nWhen he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone\u2026\nCowboy\n\nNo, no, no, no, enough\n\nGoony goo-goo, loony cuckoo\nLike Gary Gnu off \"New Zoo Revue\", but who knew\nThe mask had a loose screw? Hell, could hardly tell\nHad to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell\nIt speaks well of the hyper base\nWasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace\nCouldn't wait for the snipes to place\nAt least a tracklist in bold print typeface\nStopped for a year\nCome back with thumbtacks, pop full of beer\nWe're hip hop sharecroppers\nUsed to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers\nHe's in it for the quiche\nYou might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?\nOh, my aching hands\nFrom raking in grands and breaking in mic stands\nVillain\u2014his smile stuns ya chick\nWhile he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks\nYou heard it on the radio, tape it\nPlay it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit\nRaw lyrics\u2014he smells 'em like a hunch\nThe same intuition that tells him \"spike the punch\"\nCurses, he's truly the worsest\nWith enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes\nLet the beat blast, she told him wear the mask\nHe said you bet your sweet ass\nIt's made of fine chrome alloy\nFind him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy\n\n\nSometimes they were comedic\u2014 or relentlessly horrifying\nThey were the foes of society, whether fighting the local sheriff, or a secret agent\nFrequently they mirrored our times: the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day\nCollectively, they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come\nThe villains"

Let me update\nWhat did she say?\nShe said she'd, \"Love to rendezvous\"\nShe asked me, \"What we were gonna do?\"\nSaid we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\n\nNine was the time\n'Cause I'll be getting mine\nAnd she was looking fine\nSmooth talker\nShe told me\nShe'd love to unfold me all night long\nOoh, I loved the way she kicked it\nFrom the front to back she flipped it\n(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)\nAnd I, oh-oh, I, yeah\nHope that she'd care\n'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh, yeah)\n\nI'm not a man to play around, baby (Ooh, yeah)\n'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair\nFrom the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that\n'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that\nFrom the subway to my home\nEndless ringing off my phone\nWhen you're feeling all alone\nAll you gotta do\nIs just call me, call me\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\n\n(Break it down, break it down)\nSince I met this special lady\nOoh, yeah\nI can't get her off my mind\nShe's one of a kind\nAnd I ain't about to deny it\nIt's a special kind of thing\nWith you, oh\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\n(Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday)"
